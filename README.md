# Python 3 Programming Specialization

This repository contains my work and assignments from the **Python 3 Programming Specialization** by the **University of Michigan** on Coursera. This specialization is designed to help learners become proficient in Python programming, focusing on core programming concepts, data structures, web scraping, and handling APIs.

## What You'll Learn

- **Python 3 Basics**: From variables and conditionals to loops and functions.
- **Intermediate Concepts**: Including keyword parameters, list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and class inheritance.
- **Practical Applications**: Writing programs that query Internet APIs for data and extract useful information.
- **Debugging Skills**: Learning to reason about program execution to debug programs effectively.

By the end of the specialization, you'll be equipped to use new modules and APIs independently by reading documentation, setting a strong foundation for becoming an independent Python programmer.

## Courses Included

1. **Python Basics**: Introduction to Python programming, covering variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
2. **Data Structures**: Understanding and using lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples in Python.
3. **Using Python to Access Web Data**: Techniques for web scraping and handling data from the internet.
4. **Databases with Python**: Working with databases using Python's SQLite module.
5. **Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv**: An extended project involving optical character recognition (OCR) and object detection in images.
